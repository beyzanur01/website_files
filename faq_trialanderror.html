      <ul> <li> I started watching this anime called "Miss Kobayashi's Maid Dragon" <b> ironically </b> because my friends said that I look and act like Miss Kobayashi and I liked it and when I was trying to find a concept for the website I thought "Maybe I should make a maid cafe!" and the word "maid" made me think of the dragon maid anime and this happened I'm so sorry. </li> </ul>
