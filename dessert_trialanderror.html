<figcaption> Namagashi: Namagashi are a type of wagashi, which is a general term for snacks used in the Japanese tea ceremony. Namagashi may contain fruit jellies, other gelatines such as Kanten or sweetened bean paste. It is beautifully designed in detail using seasonal and natural motifs such as leaves and flowers to reflect the various objects of nature in Japan's four seasons. Namagashi are usually freshly made and contain 30% more moisture than other wagashi. Like other wagashi, namagashi are made of natural ingredients, additives are rarely used.</figcaption>

<figcaption> Imagawayaki: Imagawayaki is a Japanese dessert often found at Japanese festivals as well as outside Japan. It is made of batter in a special pan (similar to a waffle iron but without the honeycomb pattern), and filled with sweet bean paste, although it is becoming increasingly popular to use a wider variety of fillings such as vanilla custard, different fruit custards and preserves, curry, different meat and vegetable fillings, potato and mayonnaise.[1][2] Imagawayaki are similar to Dorayaki, but the latter are two separate pancakes sandwiched around the filling after cooking, and are often served cold.</figcaption>

  <figcaption> Sakuramochi: Sakuramochi is a Japanese sweet consisting of sweet pink-colored rice cake with a red bean paste center, and wrapped in a pickled cherry blossom (sakura) leaf. Different regions of Japan have different styles of sakuramochi. Kanto-style uses shiratama-ko (rice flour) to make the rice cake, and Kansai-style uses dōmyōji-ko glutinous rice flour). The sweet is traditionally eaten during the spring season, and especially on Girl's Day (hinamatsuri) and at flower viewing parties (hanami).</figcaption>
